{27 Mineral fuels, mineral oils and products of their distillation; bituminous substances, mineral waxes}
(I don't want to use this because ut includes mineral products that are not used for energy production, such as asphalt or paraffin wax)

2701 Coal, briquettes, ovoids and similar solid fuels manufactured from coal
	270111 Anthracite
	270112 Bituminous coal
	270119 Coal, whether or not pulverised, non-agglomerated (excluding anthracite and bituminous coal)
	270120 Briquettes, ovoids and similar solid fuels manufactured from coal
2702 Lignite, whether or not agglomerated
	270210	Lignite, whether or not pulverised, non-agglomerated (excluding jet)
	270220 Agglomerated lignite (excluding jet)

2703 Peat (mainly exported from European countries -> only relevant for nations w/out BRI energy investment)

2704 Coke and semi-coke of coal, of lignite or of peat, whether or not agglomerated; retort carbon (no sub-group)

{2705 Coal gas, water gas, producer gas, lean gas and similar gases} (is not traded internationally)
{2706 Tar distilled from coal, from lignite or from peat, and other mineral tars} (not an energy product and not traded)
{2707 Oils and other products of the distillation of high temperature coal tar} (not included bc, with the exception of benzene, most sub-group
commodities are used in the chemical industries and for plastic production, not for energy production (toluene, xylene, naphthalene, creosote, phenols))
{2708 Pitch and pitch coke} (used as raw material for building production equipment for semiconductor or solar array panel)

2709 Petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals, crude 
[Probably not all of this oil is used for energy generation, some of it will be processed and used for other purposes. So?]

{2710 Petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (excluding crude); preparations containing >= 70% by weight of petroleum oils or of oils obtained from bituminous minerals, 
these oils being the basic constituents of the preparations, n.e.s.; waste oils containing mainly petroleum or bituminous minerals} 
(For many of the codes in this group, no data is available (Source: Trademaps). The HS codes for which data is available are listed below)

271000 Petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals
271011 Light oils and preparations, of petroleum or bituminous minerals which >= 90% by volume incl. losses" distil at 210°C "ASTM D 86 method"
(Before its creation in 2002, the code 271011 was unofficially used, meaning "Aviation spirit".
Before using the Harmonized System (HS), some countries detailed their trade for various refined petroleum products in the SITC nomenclature (revisions 2 and 3). When these countries started to report in the HS nomenclature, they decided to use unofficial codes, like 271011, in order to continue detailing the refined petroleum products. 
In the 2002 revision of the HS, the code 271011 was actually officially created, but with a new label "Light petroleum oils and preparations".)

271012 Light oils and preparations, of petroleum or bituminous minerals which >= 90% by volume "incl. losses" distil at 210°C "ASTM D 86 method" (excluding containing biodiesel)
(Before its creation in 2012, the code 271012 was unofficially used, meaning "Petroleum spirit for motor vehicles".)
271019 Medium oils and preparations, of petroleum or bituminous minerals, not containing biodiesel, n.e.s.
(Before its creation in 2002, the code 271019 was unofficially used, meaning "Light petroleum distillates nes".)
271020 Petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (other than crude) and preparations n.e.s. or included, containing by weight 70 % or more of petroleum oils or of oils obtained from bituminous minerals, these oils being the basic constituents of the preparations, containing biodiesel (excluding waste oils)

{271091 Waste oils containing polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], polychlorinated terphenyls [PCTs] or polybrominated biphenyls [PBBs]}
{271099 Waste oils containing mainly petroleum or bituminous minerals (excluding those containing polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], polychlorinated terphenyls [PCTs] or polybrominated biphenyls [PBBs])}

2711 Petroleum gas and other gaseous hydrocarbons
	271111 Natural gas, liquefied
	271112 Propane, liquefied
	271113 Butanes, liquefied
	271114 Ethylene, propylene, butylene and butadiene, liquefied
	271119 Gaseous hydrocarbons, liquefied, n.e.s. (exlcuding all before)
	271121 Natural gas in gaseous state
	271129 Hydrocarbons in gaseous state (excluding natural gas)

{2712 Petroleum jelly, paraffin wax, micro- crystalline petroleum wax...} (not commonly used as energy source)

{2713 Petroleum coke, petroleum bitumen and other residues of petroleum oil}
	{271320 Petroleum bitumen (= asphalt)}
	271311 Petroleum coke, non-calcined
	271312 Petroleum coke, calcined
	{271390 Residues of petroleum oil or of oil obtained from bituminous minerals (excluding petroleum coke and petroleum bitumen)}
	(I honestly have no idea what this is, but a) it's trade volume is small and b) if it was used for energy production frequently, it 
	would probably have a more specific name)
{2714 Bitumen and asphalt, natural; bituminous or oil-shale and tar sands; asphaltites and asphaltic rocks}
{2715 Bituminous mastics, cut-backs and other bituminous mixtures based on natural asphalt, on natural bitumen, on petroleum bitumen, on mineral tar or on mineral tar pitch}
{2716 Electrical energy} (not used because no information on its production is given)
